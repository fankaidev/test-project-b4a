It covers various aspects, including color palette, typography, border radius, layout, and spacing.\n\n## Key Design Elements\n- **Color Palette**: Defined by primary colors (`#F9816E`, `#FFBB99`, `#E5684F`), background colors (`#E7E7DB`, `#F9F9F5`, `#FFFFFFE6`), text colors (`#000000`, `#808080`, `#999999`), and functional colors (`#A6DBE5` for success, `#F4B495` for warning).\n- **Typography**: Utilizes a base font (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\"`) with specific line heights and font sizes for different text roles (caption, body, card title, page title, headline, display).\n- **Border Radius**: Specifies rounded corners for buttons, inputs, cards, and containers, with no traditional borders or dividers.\n- **Layout & Spacing**: Based on a spacing scale (tight, compact, standard, comfortable) for margins, padding, and gaps between elements, ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.\n- **Tailwind Component Examples**: Provides guidelines for creating basic UI components like progress bars, buttons, labels/tags/badges, and data entry fields using utility classes.\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- The design emphasizes the use of surface color contrast and spacing to create boundaries, with shadows used sparingly for floating elements.\n- It includes a detailed mobile layout template, outlining the structure for the top fixed header, main scrollable content area, and bottom fixed area, ensuring consistency across different screen sizes.\n- Utility classes from Tailwind CSS are recommended for styling components, avoiding custom CSS classes and styles.\n\nThis design system is intended to provide a clear, consistent, and aesthetically pleasing user experience across various platforms and devices.",
