## 2. Core Problems

1. **Fragmented Cosplay Experience**
   Cosplay enthusiasts currently rely on disparate platforms for buying/selling costumes, connecting with peers, and finding convention information, leading to inefficiency and missed opportunities.
2. **Limited Community Coordination Tools**
   It's challenging for cosplayers to effectively coordinate group projects, meet-ups, or convention attendance with others who share their specific interests.

## 3. Users & Scenarios

### Key Personas

- **The Aspiring Cosplayer** — A beginner or casual cosplayer who wants to buy or rent specific costumes or props without the hassle of crafting, and is looking for a supportive community.
- **The Master Crafter / Seller** — An experienced cosplayer or artisan who creates high-quality costumes and props and wants an easy way to sell or rent them to a niche audience, while also connecting with fellow creators.
- **The Convention Goer** — A social cosplayer whose primary focus is attending conventions, meeting new people, and coordinating group cosplays or meet-ups with friends.

### Core Task Flow (Happy Path)

1. User logs in and browses the "For You" feed showcasing new listings and community posts.
2. User searches for a specific character costume using advanced filters (e.g., character, size, rental period).
3. User finds a suitable listing, reviews details, and initiates a chat with the seller.
4. User then navigates to the "Conventions" section, discovers an upcoming event, and RSVPs.
5. User creates a "Squad" for that convention, inviting friends and coordinating group cosplay plans within the app's chat system.

## 4. Copy & Tone

- **Tone Guidelines** - Enthusiastic, supportive, inspiring, and direct. Use language that resonates with the cosplay community (e.g., "squad," "expo").
- **Brand Tagline (draft)** - *“Cosplay. Connect. Conquer.”*
- **Key Terms**
    - **Squad** - A group of users formed for specific coordination, especially for conventions or group cosplays.
    - **Expo** - Used interchangeably with "Convention" or "Event" to describe a large gathering of cosplayers.
    - **Rent / Buy / Sell** - Clear calls to action for the e-commerce functionalities.
    - **Character** - Refers to the specific fictional persona a costume is based on.

## 5. Competition & Inspiration

- **Etsy / eBay (General Marketplaces)** — *Highlights* Robust e-commerce features, secure transactions, wide audience reach. *Watch-outs* Not specialised for cosplay, difficult to filter for specific cosplay needs, lacks integrated community features.
- **Facebook Groups / Discord (Social Platforms)** — *Highlights* Strong community building, easy group communication, event promotion. *Watch-outs* Disorganised for transactions, information scattered, no integrated event calendar or specific cosplay filters.
- **Eventbrite / Meetup (Event Discovery)** — *Highlights* Comprehensive event listings, RSVP functionality, location-based discovery. *Watch-outs* Not cosplay-specific, no e-commerce or direct cosplay-focused social networking.
